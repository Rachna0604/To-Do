The application allows you to put the things that you just cannot afford to forget all in one place.


Besides adding 'to-do's, this application supports a super cool feature of deleating tasks once they have been successfully completed. 

You can type the task and click on "Add-Task" to add it

Just select the completed task and then click on "Delete-Task" to delete the same
